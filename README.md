# Sample Dutch Auction Project

This project demonstrates a basic Dutch auction smart contract. It comes with a contract, a test for that contract, coverage report and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
